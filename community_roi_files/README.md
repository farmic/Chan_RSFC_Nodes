This folder contains .roi files used for Infomap community detection scripts (MATLAB). 
These files are text files that have the following columns: 
ROI, MNI coordinates (X,Y,Z), Name (MNI coord with _), Anatomy (Brain), Color (Black), Bname (Brain),Bcolor (Black)
Note that the color and names are irrelevant for community detection, so Brain and Black were entered as a place holder.
